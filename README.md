# Country Trivia Game

## About

Another version of a country trivia game written in the low-level language of C. I decided to code this small application in C due to its significant importance in the world of computer science and software development. While higher-level languages offer convenience and ease of use, learning C provides a deeper understanding of fundamental programming concepts. I look forward to learning coding more programs in C in the future!

## Run

From the terminal, run:

$ gcc CountryTriviaGame.c -o out

$ ./out

Enter your name and answer the questions - good luck!
